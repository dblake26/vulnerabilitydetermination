# Homeless Vulnerability Determination Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
**Author:** Desiree Blake

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of vulnerability among individuals experiencing homelessness. The model leverages various factors to identify high-risk individuals, enabling service providers to tailor interventions that reduce the risk of victimization, death, incarceration, and prolonged homelessness. This includes a predictive model that ranks clients based on their likelihood of being highly vulnerable, which helps in identifying those who are in most need of assistance. The full report can be found at the links below.

This project is part of Desiree Blake's Capstone Project for the MS in Data Analytics at Northwest Missouri State University.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Overview**
   - Description of the dataset, data collection methodology, and data quality assessment.

2. **Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Transformation**
   - **Load Data:** Import the CSV file into a DataFrame.
   - **Handle Missing Values:** Replace empty records, 'client doesn’t know', and 'data not collected' with 'unknown'.
   - **Impute Missing Values:** Fill missing values in numerical columns with the mean.
   - **Encode Categorical Variables:** Apply one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into binary columns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conduct EDA to uncover patterns, understand correlations between factors, and visualize variable distributions. 
   - Develop the target variable based on selected indicators of vulnerability. Engineer features relevant to vulnerability prediction such as 'Target Variable' and 'Vulnerability Factors Count'. 

4. **Machine Learning Model Selection and Training**
   - **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:**
     - Load and preprocess data from `CE_APR_combined.csv`.
   - **Model Training and Evaluation:**
     - Train a Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed dataset.
     - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, classification report, and feature importance.
   - **Predictive Analysis:**
     - Generate probability predictions for each vulnerability class.
     - Compute a vulnerability score based on the probability of being in the highly vulnerable class.
   - **Client Ranking:**
     - Rank clients based on their vulnerability scores.
     - Filter out clients without an exit destination.
   - **Results and Outputs:**
     - Output a ranked list of clients with their predicted probabilities and vulnerability scores.
     - Save a CSV file of clients without exit destinations for focused prioritization.

5. **Presentation of Results and Recommendations**
   - Summarize the findings and provide actionable recommendations based on the model’s output.
