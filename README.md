# Vulnerability Determination Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
### Author: Desiree Blake

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning project that will accurately predict the likelihood of vulnerability in individuals experiencing homelessness based on defined factors. This model can help service providers identify high-risk individuals and tailor interventions to reduce the risk of victimization, death, incarceration, continued homelessness and reduce the racial disparity that exist within the homeless population. This model can additionally be used to prioritize individuals for a communities Coordinated Entry process. 

This project is Desiree Blake's Capstone Project to complete the MS in Data Analytics for Northwest Missouri State. 

## Project Phases 


1. **Data Overview:**
    - This will include data description, data collection methodology, and data quality. 
2. **Data Cleaning Preprocessing and Transformation:**
    - This will include the steps to ensure the data is adequately prepared for the machine learning modeling. 
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - This step will conduct EDA to identify patterns, understand the correlation between factors, and the distribution of variables. Visuals included. 
4. **Machine Learning Model Selection and Training:**
5. **Advanced Analysis** 
6. **Presentation of Results and Recommendations**
